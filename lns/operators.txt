novel | Generate orthogonal optimization approach not covered by existing operators
loop_tiling | Break loops into cache-friendly tiles to improve locality
loop_fusion | Combine multiple loops into one to reduce loop overhead and improve data reuse
memory_coalescing | Reorganize memory accesses for sequential/strided patterns
register_blocking | Keep intermediate values in registers across operations
data_layout_transform | Change data organization (AoS to SoA or vice versa)
strength_reduction | Replace expensive operations with cheaper equivalents
computation_reuse | Cache and reuse intermediate results instead of recomputing
branch_elimination | Remove conditionals using predication or arithmetic
instruction_interleaving | Interleave independent operations to hide latency
