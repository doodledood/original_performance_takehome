# Kernel Optimization Challenge

Optimize `KernelBuilder.build_kernel()` in `perf_takehome.py` to minimize execution cycles.

## Files

- `perf_takehome.py` - Your optimization target
- `problem.py` - Machine simulator and reference implementation

## Rules

- IMPORTANT: Read `problem.py` to understand the machine architecture and instruction set
- Lower cycle count is better
- Correctness must be maintained - incorrect solutions are worthless
